How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

The bug has to have been added during the editing.
Hence the only place it can be is in the modified lines.
“diff” only shows the lines where something has changed, so it’s easy to spot the errors.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

By tracking all the changes made over time and quickly finding introduced features/
bugs.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Allows to make logically motivated versions instead of random ones.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Because they were created for different kind of applications.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

Log gives an overview of all changes made, and diff shows what exact differences between 2 files.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

Because I could rollback at any time.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
