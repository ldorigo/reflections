When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

In case I need to collaborate on a project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

To have control on the versions of my files

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks are only on github and made to independently work on another person's code. clone is from a github repo to a local repo. A pranch is on the same repo.
