What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A .git directory is created. It is needed to start tracking changes.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It's an in-between zone. A buffer for selecting changes to be made.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

By reviewing all changes about to be made.
